# API Usage and Cost Awareness in Saiku

When integrating external API services such as OpenAI into Saiku, it's crucial to be aware of their usage rates and associated costs. Since Saiku is still in an experimental phase, understanding and managing these aspects is essential to avoid unexpected charges.

## Understanding API Costs

Each external API service used in Saiku, like OpenAI, comes with its own pricing model, which may include charges based on usage, data processed, or specific features accessed.

### Key Points:

- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of the number of API calls allowed within a certain period to avoid exceeding rate limits.
- **Cost Structure**: Understand the cost structure of each API, including any free tiers or quotas.

## Best Practices for Managing Costs

To effectively manage and minimize API costs:

### 1. Monitor API Usage

- Regularly monitor your usage of external APIs.
- Set up alerts or notifications to keep track of usage thresholds.

### 2. Optimize API Calls

- Cache responses when possible to reduce repetitive API calls.
- Structure your queries efficiently to fetch only necessary data.

### 3. Use Testing and Development Environments

- Utilize testing or development environments provided by the API services, which often have lower costs or are free.
- Be cautious when moving from a development environment to production, as this may lead to increased usage and costs.

### 4. Stay Informed About Policy Changes

- Keep up-to-date with any changes in the API providers' policies, pricing models, and rate limits.

## Managing Saiku's Experimental Features

As Saiku is still in an experimental stage:

- **Test New Integrations**: Experiment with new features or integrations in a controlled environment.
- **Feedback and Reporting**: Provide feedback or report issues to help improve Saiku's stability and functionality.
