# Configuring Saiku

Proper configuration of Saiku is crucial for leveraging its full potential in your projects. This guide focuses on setting up the `AgentOptions` to customize Saiku's behavior according to your requirements.


## Setting Environment Variables

Start by setting the necessary environment variables in your `.env` file, such as your `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI services integration.

## Customizing AgentOptions

Saiku's `AgentOptions` provide flexibility and control over how the AI agent operates in your environment. Hereâ€™s how you can configure these options:

### Available Options

- `actionsPath`: Path to custom action scripts.
- `systemMessage`: System role prompt message (optional).
- `allowCodeExecution`: Flag to enable/disable code execution (optional).
- `interactive`: Enable interactive mode for user input (boolean or string).
- `speech`: Configure speech functionality (`input`, `output`, `both`, `none`).
- `llm`: Specify the language learning model (`openai`, `vertexai`, `huggingface`, `ollama`).
- `[key: string]`: Additional custom properties for unique project requirements.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of setting `AgentOptions` in your application:

```javascript
import Agent from 'saiku/agents/agent';

const agentOptions = {
  actionsPath: "../actions",
  systemMessage: "Your custom system message here",
  allowCodeExecution: true,
  interactive: true,
  speech: "none",
  llm: "openai" // Default language learning model
};

const agent = new Agent(agentOptions);
```

## Testing Your Configuration

After setting up your `AgentOptions`, it's important to test Saiku to ensure it functions as expected. Run a simple interaction test as described in our [Verifying Installation](/verifying-installation) guide.
