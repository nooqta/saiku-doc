# Setting Up Environment Variables for Saiku

Environment variables are essential for configuring Saiku to work effectively with various services and APIs. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up these variables.

## Understanding Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store configuration settings outside of your application code. They help in managing sensitive data like API keys and project identifiers.

## Common Environment Variables for Saiku

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your personal API key for OpenAI services.

## Creating the Environment File

1. **Create a `.env` File**: In your project's root directory, create a new file named `.env`.

```bash
touch .env
```

2. **Add Your Variables**: Open the `.env` file and insert your environment variables.

```plaintext
# Example .env file content
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Loading Environment Variables

To make use of these variables in your Saiku project, load them at the start of your application.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();

console.log(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY); // Use your variables
```

<Warning>
  It's crucial to keep your `.env` file secure. Do not commit it to version control, as it often contains sensitive information like API keys.
</Warning>

Properly setting up environment variables is key to ensuring that Saiku operates smoothly, particularly when interfacing with external services and APIs.
