#### Setting Up a Test Script

Create a file named `test-saiku.js` in your project directory and insert the following code:

```javascript
import Agent from 'saiku/agents/agent';

async function testSaiku() {
  const agent = new Agent();
  const userQuery = "Hello Saiku";

  const response = await agent.interact(userQuery);
  console.log(response.text);
}

testSaiku();
```

#### Running the Test Script

To run the test, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node test-saiku.js
```

When executed, this script will initialize a Saiku agent and process the query "Hello Saiku". It will then output Saiku's response to the console.
