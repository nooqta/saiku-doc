# Understanding Modular Design in Saiku

Saiku's architecture is built on the principles of modular design, which plays a crucial role in its functionality and extensibility. This approach allows individual components or modules to operate independently while still contributing to the overall functionality of the system.

## What is Modular Design?

Modular design refers to the practice of structuring a system as a collection of distinct and interchangeable modules. Each module is designed to perform a specific function and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### Key Benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Easier to adapt or replace modules without affecting the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies the addition of new features or enhancements.
- **Maintainability**: Independent modules are easier to understand, debug, and update.

## Saiku's Modular Components

Saiku comprises several key modular components:

### 1. Agent

- **Function**: The Agent acts as the central coordinator, managing interactions and workflows.
- **Modularity**: Incorporates different modules for tasks like decision-making, memory management, and interaction handling.

### 2. Language Learning Models (LLMs)

- **Purpose**: Provides natural language processing capabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Different LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Google VertexAI) are implemented as interchangeable modules.

### 3. Actions

- **Role**: Perform specific tasks like file operations or data processing.
- **Independent Development**: Each action is a self-contained module, allowing for isolated development and integration.

## Working with Modular Design in Saiku

When developing or extending Saiku:

- **Creating New Modules**: Develop new actions or functionalities as separate modules, following the established patterns.
- **Inter-module Communication**: Understand how modules interact with each other, typically through the Agent.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Test modules independently before integrating them into the larger system.

## Example: Adding a New Action

```javascript
// Example of creating a new action module in Saiku
import { Action } from 'saiku/interfaces/action';
import Agent from 'saiku/agents/agent';

class NewAction implements Action {
  // Define action properties and methods
  ...
}

// Integration with Saiku
const agent = new Agent();
agent.addAction('newAction', new NewAction(agent));
```
<Note>
  Embracing modular design enhances the robustness and adaptability of Saiku. Whether you're contributing new features or customizing existing ones, consider the modular nature of the system.
</Note>
Modular design is a cornerstone of Saiku's architecture, providing the foundation for its dynamic and adaptable nature. By understanding and utilizing this approach, developers can effectively contribute to and extend Saiku's capabilities.
