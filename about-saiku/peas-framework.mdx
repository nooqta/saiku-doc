# The PEAS Framework in Saiku

Saiku is built on the foundational PEAS framework, which stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. This framework is crucial in defining the capabilities and effectiveness of Saiku as an intelligent AI agent.


## Understanding PEAS

PEAS is a framework used to describe the components of an intelligent agent like Saiku, ensuring it operates optimally in various environments and scenarios.

<MintTabs>
  <MintTab label="Performance Measure">
    The criteria for evaluating the agent's success in achieving its goals.
  </MintTab>
  <MintTab label="Environment">
    The setting or context in which the agent operates.
  </MintTab>
  <MintTab label="Actuators">
    The tools or methods the agent uses to interact with its environment.
  </MintTab>
  <MintTab label="Sensors">
    How the agent perceives its surroundings and gathers information.
  </MintTab>
</MintTabs>

## Performance Measure (Not Implemented)

The Performance Measure defines success for Saiku, guiding its decision-making process to align with predefined goals and objectives.

<Note type="success">
  Saiku's performance is continuously evaluated against specific success metrics, ensuring alignment with user expectations and project objectives.
</Note>

## Environment

The Environment component of the PEAS framework refers to the operational domain of Saiku. It’s where Saiku applies its skills, whether in a simple task or a complex workflow.

  <MintAccordionItem title="User Inputs">
    Interpreting and responding to user commands and queries.
  </MintAccordionItem>
  <MintAccordionItem title="Data Analysis">
    Processing and analyzing data for informed action taking.
  </MintAccordionItem>
  <MintAccordionItem title="Environmental Awareness">
    Adapting to changes and new information in its operational environment.
  </MintAccordionItem>
