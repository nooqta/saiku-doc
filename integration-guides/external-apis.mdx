# Integrating External APIs with Saiku

Saiku's flexible architecture allows for the integration of a wide range of external APIs, extending its capabilities beyond its core functionalities. This guide provides an overview of how to integrate and interact with external APIs within the Saiku framework.

## Overview of External API Integration

Integrating external APIs can significantly broaden the functionalities of Saiku, allowing it to interact with various services and platforms.

### Key Considerations:

- **Authentication**: Understand the authentication mechanism required by the external API (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).
- **Request Format**: Familiarize yourself with the request structure expected by the API.
- **Response Handling**: Prepare to handle and parse the responses from the API.

## Steps for Integration

Integrate external APIs into your Saiku project with the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the API">
    Research and select the external API that suits your requirements. Ensure it provides the necessary endpoints and data you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain Credentials">
    Register or sign up for the external API to obtain necessary credentials, such as API keys or client IDs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Environment">
    Add the obtained credentials to your Saiku environment, typically via environment variables or configuration files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement API Calls">
    Develop the functionality in Saiku to call the external API. This might involve creating new actions or modifying existing ones.
    - Use libraries like `axios` or `fetch` for HTTP requests.
    - Ensure proper error handling and response parsing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Thoroughly test the API integration to ensure it works as expected. Handle any edge cases or potential errors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document the Integration">
    Maintain clear documentation of how the external API is integrated and used within Saiku, including any specific configurations or steps required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Integrating a Weather API

Here's a brief example of how you might integrate a weather API with Saiku:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript As Dependency
// Example of using Saiku as a dependency in your project
import Agent from 'saiku/agents/agent';

async function main() {
  const agent = new Agent();
  // The agent will automatically load all actions in the `actions` directory and shall decide which one to use based on the intent
  const response = await agent.interact('What is the weather like today?');
  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```
```javascript As Standalone
// Example of contributing to the Saiku project
import Agent from './path/to/agent';
import WeatherAction from './path/to/actions/weatherAction';

async function enhanceAgent() {
  const agent = new Agent();
  const weatherAction = new WeatherAction();
  agent.functions[weatherAction.name] = weatherAction;

  // Test the new action
  const response = await agent.run['weather'].run({ city: 'Paris' });
  console.log('Weather in Paris:', response);
}

enhanceAgent();
```

<Note>
  When integrating external APIs, always adhere to their usage policies and terms of service. Be mindful of rate limits and data usage restrictions.
