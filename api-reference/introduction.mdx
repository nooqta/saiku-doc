# Introduction to Saiku API Reference

Welcome to the Saiku API Reference. This documentation provides a holistic view of Saiku's architecture, highlighting its core components and functionalities. Saiku is built with modularity and flexibility in mind, enabling robust AI-driven automation and interactions.

## Overall Architecture

Saiku's architecture is centered around several key components, each designed to perform specific roles within the system:

### 1. Agent

- **Role**: The Agent acts as the central coordinator for Saiku, handling user interactions, decision-making, and task execution.
- **Documentation**: Detailed information about the Agent's properties and methods can be found in [Agent](/api-reference/agent).

### 2. Language Learning Models (LLMs)

- **Purpose**: LLMs, such as OpenAI, Google VertexAI, and others, provide natural language processing capabilities, crucial for understanding and generating human-like text.
- **Documentation**: For specifics on each model, visit the LLMs section under [LLMs](/api-reference/llms).

### 3. Actions

- **Functionality**: Actions are modular units responsible for executing specific tasks, like file operations, data processing, and more.
- **Documentation**: Explore the various actions and their usages in [Actions](/api-reference/actions).

## Navigating the Documentation
