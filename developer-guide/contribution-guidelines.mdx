## Getting Started

Before contributing, it's important to familiarize yourself with the Saiku project. Spend some time understanding its architecture, coding standards, and current issues or feature requests.

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the issue or feature request.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).

## Pull Requests

We encourage pull requests that improve the codebase or add beneficial features. Hereâ€™s how to create a pull request:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the Saiku repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Implement your changes in the feature branch, adhering to the existing coding standards and practices.

### 4. Commit and Push Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear message describing the fix or feature. Then push the branch to your forked repository:
