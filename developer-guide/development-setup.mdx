# Development Setup for Saiku

Setting up your development environment correctly is crucial for a smooth experience when working with Saiku. This guide will take you through the process of preparing your development setup, ensuring you have all the necessary tools and configurations in place.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
