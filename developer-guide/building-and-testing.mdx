# Building and Testing Saiku

Building and testing are crucial steps in the development process of Saiku. This guide provides information on how to build the Saiku project and outlines our current testing needs.

## Building Saiku

To build Saiku, follow these steps after you have cloned the repository and set up your development environment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    First, make sure all necessary dependencies are installed:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the Project">
    Use this command to build the Saiku project:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    
    This compiles the source code and prepares it for execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch for Changes">
    For development, you can use the watch command to automatically rebuild the project when files change:
    
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```
    
    This command helps streamline the development process.
  </Step>
</Steps>
